Kinesis Countour + Colemak + VIM Notes

These notes are for anyone, who, like me, learn new software tools as a means of procrastination.  Obviously, for this purpose, the sharper the learning curve for the tool, the better.  Contoured keyboards, colemak, and vim

I will refer to the "Kinesis Advantage Contoured MPC/USB Whatever" simply as "The Kinesis"; they don't make any other products of interest anyway.

If you are reading this, you have probably already hardware re-mapped your Caps Lock key to be your primary control key.  If not, go do it now.  Ignore Colemak's suggestion to use the Caps Lock key as a delete key; that is for keyboards with crap delete keys.

Hardware remap the kinesis arrow keys to an order that you like (and swap the key caps while you're at it).  I kept Left and Right paired on my left hand, and Down, and Up paired on my right hand.

The Escape key on the kinesis sucks; use vim's standard alternative <Control-[> instead to get out of Insert mode. 

Ignore the "home-row" vim arrow keys; you could learn them, but they are no longer in sensical places, and they will only work in vim.  Instead, use the easily reachable arrow keys you paid for.

Ignore vim's "0" (chorded) "$" for bol and eol moves.  Instead, just use the kinesis' easily reachable Home and End keys.
